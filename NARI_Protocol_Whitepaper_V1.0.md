# THE NARI PROTOCOL: A DECENTRALIZED INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ETHICAL AI GOVERNANCE

## 1. ABSTRACT AND PROBLEM DEFINITION

The rapid expansion of Generative AI poses significant challenges to **data sovereignty**, **privacy**, and **algorithmic safety**, particularly when deployed in sensitive public sectors such as child welfare. Reliance on centralized cloud providers for storing data related to vulnerable populations (like children with Complex Trauma) introduces unacceptable risk (GDPR, EU AI Act).

The **NARI Protocol** proposes a fork of the existing **Filecoin Protocol** to create a dedicated, decentralized storage and governance layer. This layer is designed not for commercial data storage but for the secure, verifiable, and ethically controlled storage of **Digital Public Goods (DPG)** data, specifically for the **AI-CARE Initiative (Trauma-Informed Prompt Engineering)**.

## 2. JUSTIFICATION FOR FORKING FILECOIN

Standard Filecoin tokenomics and governance are not optimized for ethical enforcement and cost-efficiency required by public goods research. The NARI fork allows us to embed **Child Data Sovereignty** and **Ethical VETO capabilities** directly into the core protocol layer.

| Feature | Standard Filecoin | NARI Protocol (Proposed Fork) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Incentive** | Commercial storage and retrieval pricing. | **Public Good Tokenomics:** Subsidized or zero-cost storage for verified Digital Public Goods (DPGs) and non-profit research (NARI). |
| **Governance** | Generalized community/miner voting. | **Ethical Governance Layer:** Incorporates mechanisms for external, auditable ethical controls. |
| **Focus** | Generalized Storage. | Child Data Sovereignty and Ethical Enforcement. |

## 3. CORE ARCHITECTURE AND THE VETO INTEGRATION

The NARI Protocol is an integrated stack for the AI-CARE system:

### 3.1. Decentralized Storage (The Fork)

The forked protocol will primarily store two key data sets required by the AI-CARE project:
1.  **TIPE Protocol Codebase:** Immutable, verifiable storage of the Open Source prompt engineering layers.
2.  **Anonymized Clinical Data:** Secure, verifiable storage of the clinically validated metrics (SDQ/KINDL) used to monitor child well-being, accessible only by verified NARI/HI clinical nodes.

### 3.2. Ethical Governance Layer: The VETO Mechanism

The VETO Protocol, driven by the clinical team (Dr. Balla Gyula), is designed to be enforced at the decentralized infrastructure level.

* **Mechanism:** When the clinical system registers a `WELLBEING_VETO_FLAG` (triggered by clinical data deterioration), this signal is relayed to the **NARI Protocol Governance Smart Contract**.
* **Effect:** The smart contract can immediately **revoke access** or **halt processing power** tied to the specific child's data stream within the protocol. This ensures that the ethical control is **cryptographically enforceable** and cannot be circumvented by the AI model itself.

## 4. PROJECT IMPACT AND SUSTAINABILITY

The NARI Protocol is foundational to securing major grants (ERC, Horizon Europe) because it solves the core ethical and legal hurdle of deploying frontier AI in the public sector. The protocol, as a **Digital Public Good**, will be offered Open Source, allowing other child welfare or sensitive public health initiatives globally to adopt ethically sound, decentralized AI infrastructure.
