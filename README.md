## COMING SOON - PROTOTYPE 2025

**Mission:** Empowering children in child protection care through ethical, AI-driven educational tutoring.

### **THE PROBLEM**
Over 23,000 children in the Hungarian child welfare system face complex trauma and educational gaps. Standard solutions often fail to address these deep-rooted challenges.

### **OUR SOLUTION: AI-CARE**
We are developing an open-source, AI-powered platform designed to act strictly as an educational **TUTOR** (Math, Reading), built with a trauma-informed lens.
* **Safety First:** We utilize Anthropic's Claude API for its safety focus (Constitutional AI).
* **Ethical Framework:** Wellbeing is monitored by a trauma expert (VETO right). **AI-CARE is NOT therapy.**
* **Target:** Children in Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg County (26 locations).

### **KEY PARTNERS**
* Nash Alicia Research Institution (NARI)
* Child Welfare Institution (26 locations)
* Dr. Balla Gyula (Trauma Psychologist)
