# 🤝 TEAM STRUCTURE AND SCALE STRATEGY

This document outlines the interdisciplinary strengths of the AI-CARE team and the dual organizational structure designed for system-level change and long-term sustainability (Ashoka Criteria).

## 1. INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM STRENGTHS

The project's credibility stems from the unique intersection of its three leaders:

* **TECHNOLOGY & EXECUTION (Somogyi Péter):** Provides the technical architecture, AI integration, blockchain foundation, and executive drive (Builder Track). **Experience:** 20+ years of deep tech development, direct educational experience with the target group.
* **PRACTICE & INSTITUTIONAL ACCESS (Bessenyei Gyula Attila):** Provides immediate, trusted access to the target population (26 facilities) and the pedagogical framework for implementation. **Experience:** Institution Director, early adopter of creative technologies (Suno).
* **ETHICS & SAFETY (Balla Gyula):** Provides the critical clinical oversight, trauma expertise, and the authority for ethical intervention (Veto Right). **Experience:** Child and Organizational Psychologist, trauma specialist.

## 2. DUAL ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL (Sustainability)

AI-CARE is sustained by a dual-entity model, ensuring non-profit R&D is backed by independent revenue streams:

| Entity | Role | TEÁOR Code Focus | Sustainability Model |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nash Alicia Research Institution (NARI)** | **R&D and Ethics:** Owns the open-source code, manages the ethical framework, and pursues research grants (UNICEF, Ashoka, EU). | 72.19 (Kutatás-fejlesztés) | Public funding, grants, tax benefits. |
| **Somogyi Strategy & Research Kft. (For-Profit)** | **Executive & Revenue:** Manages commercial activities, UNGM tenders, and B2G/B2B adoption projects. | 70.22 (Üzletviteli tanácsadás) | Cross-subsidizes NARI's R&D during lean periods; ensures core staff compensation. |

This dual structure ensures that the **social mission (NARI)** is protected, while the **financial viability (Consult Kft.)** remains strong, making the project resilient and scalable.

## 3. SCALE PATHWAY

* **Phase 1 (2027):** Pilot Study (20-30 children) in Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg County (Bessenyei Center).
* **Phase 2 (2028-2029):** National Adoption (23,000 children) across Hungarian child welfare system, leveraging Phase 1 results for Government/EU funding (B2G model).
* **Phase 3 (Post-2030):** Regional/Global Open-Source Dissemination to Central-Eastern Europe and international foster care systems, leveraging the MIT license and decentralized data structure.

## 4. CRITICAL ETHICAL AND IP FRAMEWORK

### 4.1. DATA PRIVACY AND ANTI-EXPLOITATION

* **Core Policy:** **CHILDREN'S DATA WILL NEVER BE SOLD.** Data usage is restricted strictly to improving the child's academic outcomes and psychological safety within the AI-CARE framework.
* **GDPR:** Full compliance with EU GDPR standards is mandatory.
* **Data Hosting:** Decentralized infrastructure (FileCoin fork) is used to ensure maximum data sovereignty and security.

### 4.2. OPEN SOURCE VS. KNOW-HOW

The dual model enables us to maintain an open-source commitment while ensuring the team retains ownership of the core intellectual value.

| Asset | Ownership/License | Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Source Code** | **MIT License (Open-Source)** | The entire code base, including LangChain framework, Veto logic, and API calls. |
| **Methodology/Know-How** | **33.333% Equal Split** | The non-code intellectual property (IP), including trauma-informed prompt engineering protocols, educator training materials, pedagogical models, and Balla's psychological safety protocols. |

This ensures that the **code is free** for nonprofits (mitigating harm) while the **specialized expertise (Know-How)** that generates the B2G/B
